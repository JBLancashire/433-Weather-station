This is very much an experiment and work in progress.

By not using interrupt triggering I found that noise reduction was much easier.
Uses pulseIn() instead of digitalRead() to measure incoming pulses.
CRC checking is done and bad packets will be ignored.
SENSOR ID diplayed is the last sensor unit that has been recieved.
  it is not being used for anything else.
Data for all sensors is stored in the weather_station structure.

The code has only been tested on an UNO R3.
Rain sensor has not been tested as i dont currently have access to one.
Threshold values may need adjustment for some recievers.
